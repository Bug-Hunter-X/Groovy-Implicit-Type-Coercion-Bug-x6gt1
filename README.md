This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed bug in Groovy related to implicit type coercion.  The `myMethod` function aims to return the larger of two numbers. However, if the inputs are of inconsistent types (e.g., a String and an Integer), the comparison might not behave as expected, due to Groovy's flexible typing. This example highlights the importance of explicit type handling for robustness.
